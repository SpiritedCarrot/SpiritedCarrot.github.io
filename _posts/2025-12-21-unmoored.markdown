I watched you stumble through the dark.

You were not prepared when you crossed the border into my realm. People rarely are. They arrive unexpectedly, and yet the reasons are always clear.

Usually, those who reach the grove have already begun to change. Their hearts are raw. Their minds have scattered somewhere earlier on the road.

Yesterday you were still among others. You sat close to them. You knew life. It was all you had ever known, and you believed you knew it well. It is an easy mistake to confuse that with safety. You felt at home in your life. Most people do, right until they don’t.

On the way here you looked back. You were surprised to see them clearing the stage. There is an intermission, and then the play goes on. Someone has already put a cardboard cutout where you used to stand. From a distance it looks convincing.

You will remain part of the play as long as your body carries you. You will answer messages. You will nod at the right moments. You will say you’re fine. But what you are, what you were, is already on the way. It is mine now.

You went to the spring because you were thirsty. That is what you tell yourself. The truth is simpler: you went because you could not stay away. When you arrived, you were already numb. I didn’t have to touch you. I didn’t have to do anything at all.

Now you stand at the pond. The water is black and still. Your face reflected in it, slightly distorted. You look like a stranger.

I look at you and feel something close to pity. I cannot take your pain away. Not cleanly. Not the way people imagine. There is no simple gesture. No mercy that doesn’t cost something.

So I do what I always do. I wait. I witness. And I let you carry your life. Only experiences, one after another, until the body gives way.

In my garden many lights are burning. They are fueled by memory and love. Each one seems, to the one who brought it, unbearably important. It means everything. And everything is all you ever had.

“You are one of many,” I whisper. “Many arrived before you. Many will come after.”

You hear the words. But you cannot understand the beauty hidden underneath.
