I ended up in the other bathroom again. I opened the door, and the first thing I noticed was the cold light and the threatening walls closing in on me.

My actual bathroom has none of that existential dread. There’s lemon-flavored toothpaste from Sicily that I bought because I thought it was such a quirky thing to own. It even has a captain drawn on the tube. My favorite plush green bathrobe hangs on the door. Inside a glass jar, I added some moss and plants, in the hope they might survive, unlike the other plants I have tried to put here to lighten up the room.

In this bathroom, all of those things are here, too. Well, their physical representations are. Sometimes I wonder if this is what the world looks like outside of me. The real world, I mean. The one you’d see if you weren’t human, or animal, or anything that can attach meaning to an object. And I wonder why the lack of meaning makes me want to crawl out of my own skin.

It’s annoying, really. The same door leads to both bathrooms. Sometimes when I leave, I step into the other corridor, the one that goes to the other living room. 

Great, I think. Now I have to sit here in despair, again.
